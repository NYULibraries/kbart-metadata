# kbart-metadata
This repository contains KBART metadata files describing NYU Libraries-produced open access digital collections. At the moment, the repository only contains KBART files for the Ancient World Digital Library. In addition to KBART files, this repository also includes associated documentation (such as the NYU KBART source spreadsheet profile).

## filenaming
The Python script used to create KBART metadata produces two files: a NISO-compliant KBART and an OCLC KBART. The files are named as follows:

nyu_oclc_awdl_YYYY-MM-DD.txt

nyu_global_awdl_YYYY-MM-DD.txt

## modifying jupyter notebook
To modify the jupyter notebook, first open a bash shell/terminal window and start jupyter lab or jupyter notebook.
